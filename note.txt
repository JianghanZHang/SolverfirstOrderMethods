The value of /miu represent the sensitivity of the constraints (i.e. how strong is the gradient along the direction which satisfy the constraints)
Question: 
for the Augmented Lagrangian method:
How to find a proper initialization and updating scheme of miu 
that could achieve the balance between the satisfication of the constraints and the convergence of the cost?

for the Multiple shooting:
All the variants of gradient descent actually just provide a good search direction in our case.
A good (step length selection algorithm) line search algorithm is likely to be very important.

BCL -> good when the DOF is relatively small.
LCL -> good when the number of constraints is small.
